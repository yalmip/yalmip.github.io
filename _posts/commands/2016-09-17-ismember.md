[ismember] is used to constrain an [sdpvar](/command/sdpvar) object to be selected from a set of constants, or to be inside [MPT] polytopes.

### Syntax

````matlab
F = ismember(x,Y)
````

### Examples

To constrain a scalar [sdpvar](/command/sdpvar) variable to take a value from a finite set, [ismember] can be used.

````matlab
sdpvar x
F = ismember(x,[1 2 3 4]);
````

Of course, this can also be obtained with a standard integer variable

````matlab
intvar x
F = [1 <= x <=4];
````

or an integrality constraint.

````matlab
sdpvar x
F = [integer(x), 1 <= x <= 4];
````

The functionality is more useful when the set is more complicated.

````matlab
sdpvar x
F = ismember(x,[1 pi 12 -8]);
````

The function can also be used together with the polytope object in [MPT] to constrain a variable to be inside at least one of several polytopes.

````matlab
x = sdpvar(3,1);
P1 = polytope(randn(10,3),rand(10,1));
P2 = polytope(randn(10,3),rand(10,1));
F = ismember(x,[P1 P2]);
````

### Comments

Note that [ismember] will introduce binary variables if the cardinality of the set **Y** is larger than 1
