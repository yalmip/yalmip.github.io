[jacobian] calculates the symbolic Jacobian \\(df/dx\\) of a polynomial \\(f(x)\\).

### Syntax

````matlab
J = jacobian(f,x)
````

### Examples

With only 1 argument, the differentiation is performed with respect to all involved variables (more precisely, with respect to the variables **ecover(depends(f)))**

````matlab
x1 = sdpvar(1,1);
x2 = sdpvar(1,1);
f = x1^2+5*x2^2;
sdisplay(jacobian(f))
ans =
    '2*x1'   '10*x2'
````

Giving a second argument controls what variables to differentiate with respect to
````matlab
sdisplay(jacobian(f,x2))
ans =
    '10*x2'
````
