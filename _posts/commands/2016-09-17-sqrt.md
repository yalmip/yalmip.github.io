[sqrt](/command/sqrt) overloads sqrt

### Syntax
````matlab
y = sqrt(x)
````

### Comment

The operator is implemented using a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) based on a second-order cone programming model, and can thus only be used in scenarios where YALMIP can propagate convexity. If you want to avoid a graph-representation using second-order cone constraints and instead use a standard nonlinear programming approach, use [sqrtm](/command/sqrtm) instead.
