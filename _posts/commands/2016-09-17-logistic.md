[logistic](/command/logistic) is an implementation of the logistic function  \\(\frac{1}{1+exp^{-x}}\\)

### Syntax

````matlab
y = logistic(x)
````

### Comment

Note that you typically would use the convex [logsumexp](/commands/logsumexp) operator to perform logistic regression, as illustrated in the example in the [exponential cone tutorial](/tutorial/exponentialcone)

### Implementation

The operator  is implemented as a [callback operator](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback).
